# XOR-Multi-Line-File-Crypter:

XOR encryption, particularly when applied to multi-line passwords, utilizes the XOR operation on each byte of the password and a corresponding key. This simple symmetric encryption method is often used in situations where quick and reversible encryption is needed, though it's not considered highly secure against sophisticated attacks.

* Key Generation:
A key, which can be a string or a sequence of bytes, is generated. This key is used for both encryption and decryption. 
* XOR Operation:
The password (represented as a sequence of bytes) is XORed with the key. The XOR operation (exclusive OR) compares corresponding bits of the password and key. If the bits are the same, the result is 0; if they are different, the result is 1. 
* Encryption:
The XORed result becomes the encrypted password.
* Decryption:
The encrypted password is XORed again with the same key, effectively reversing the process and restoring the original password.





### Key Length:
A longer and more random key generally provides better security. If the key is shorter than the password, it will be reused cyclically. 
### Security:
XOR encryption is relatively weak. It's susceptible to attacks like frequency analysis and known-plaintext attacks. It's not recommended for sensitive data. 
### Applications:
XOR encryption is often used in simple scenarios like password protection in cross-browser testing or within malware for obfuscation, but not for protecting highly sensitive information. 
### Multiple Lines:
XOR can be applied to multi-line passwords by treating the entire password string as a sequence of bytes. 
### Encoding/Decoding:
Ensure consistent encoding (e.g., UTF-8) when converting between strings and byte arrays. 

Encrxpt/Decrypt Code:
```ruby
function FileCrypt(Source : AnsiString; Destination : AnsiString; Cle : AnsiString):boolean;
var
  FSource, Fdest :TFileStream;
  Buffer : array[1..4096] of integer;
  VCle : ^integer;
  nblu : integer;
  I , J, LongCle, a : integer;
begin
  Screen.Cursor := crHourGlass;

  If (FileExists(Source)) and (Cle <> '') then begin
    LongCle := Length(Cle);
    try
      FSource := TFileStream.Create(Source,fmOpenRead);
      FDest := TFileStream.Create(Destination, fmCreate);
      while FSource.Position < FSource.Size do begin

        nblu := FSource.Read(Buffer, 1024);

        For I:= 1 to nblu do begin
          For J:= 1 to LongCle do begin
            VCle := @Cle[J];
            Buffer[I] := Buffer[I] xor VCle^;
          end;
        end;

        FDest.Write(Buffer,nblu);
      end;
      Result := True;
    finally
      FSource.Free;
      FDest.Free;
      Screen.Cursor := crDefault;
    end;
  end else Result := False;
end;
```

Example:
Let's say the plaintext is "A" (ASCII 65, binary 01000001) and the key is "B" (ASCII 66, binary 01000010). 
```
01000001 (A)
^ 01000010 (B)
------------
  00000011 (3, not a printable ASCII character)
```

The result of XORing "A" with "B" is the binary representation of 3, which is not a printable ASCII character. 

### Why it's simple:
XOR is a basic logical operation that's easy to implement in most programming languages.
The same operation (XOR with the same key) is used for both encryption and decryption. 
### Why it's not secure: 
### Key Reuse:
If the same key is used repeatedly, it becomes vulnerable to attacks like frequency analysis or known-plaintext attacks. 
### Short Keys:
If the key is shorter than the plaintext, it will repeat, making it easier to break. 
### Lack of Diffusion and Confusion:
* XOR encryption doesn't provide good diffusion (changing one bit of the plaintext affects multiple bits of the ciphertext) or confusion (making it hard to determine the key from the ciphertext). 
### In summary:
* XOR encryption is a foundational concept in cryptography and a good starting point for understanding encryption principles, but it's not suitable for securing sensitive data in most real-world scenarios. It's often used as a component in more robust encryption algorithms. 

Python Example:
```python
def xor_encrypt_decrypt(text, key):
    """
    Encrypts or decrypts a string using XOR with a key.
    """
    key_length = len(key)
    result = bytearray()
    for i, char in enumerate(text):
        key_c = key[i % key_length]
        result.append(ord(char) ^ ord(key_c))
    return result.decode('latin-1') # or other encoding

# Example usage
password = "my_super_secret_password\nwith_multiple_lines"
key = "my_encryption_key"

encrypted_password = xor_encrypt_decrypt(password, key)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_password}")

decrypted_password = xor_encrypt_decrypt(encrypted_password, key)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_password}")
```
